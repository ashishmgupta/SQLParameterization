# SQLParameterization
A very simple project which shows three ways of executing a query - dynamic SQL, command parameters and the stored procedure.
The goal is to run the project and watch the SQL Profiler to see what is the actual query is getting executed.
/lib/DatabaseScripts.txt has all the scripts to setup your database.
