# SQLParameterization
very simple project to quickly test the executing SQL statements using dynamic SQL, query parameterization and stored procedure. This can be used alongside running your SQL profiler to check what SQL statements are getting executed on each of the three cases.
/lib/DatabaseScripts.txt has all the scripts to setup your database.
/lib/SqlHelper.txt has three functions each for dynamic SQL, query parameterzation and stored procedure.
/SqlParameterization/Program.cs has the main function.

This project was a very quick setup. So definitely there are flaws in it. :-) Will be correcting them as time permits.
Feel free to issue pull request and make changes.
